# Parameter_Calibration_for_Urban_Underlying_Surface
This repository is our codebase for PCUS: Calibration of the underlying surface parameters for urban flood using latent variables and adjoint equation. Our paper is currently being submitted for publication. We will provide more detailed guide soon.

# Basic structure
```shell
The core calsses in our code and the interaction diagram among them.
